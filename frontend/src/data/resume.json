He has been a great teacher and is very detail oriented in his explanations. There has not been a question that we have asked that has thrown him off. He has a true expertise in the field and is constantly showing his passion in his work. All of the time he has spent with us has been free of charge and he has been happy to continue to meet with us to teach us more. I cannot recommend Chris highly enough from my professional interactions with him."
